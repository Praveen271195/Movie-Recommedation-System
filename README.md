## Purpose of Repository:
Repository will contain the files for the DSCI final project for MS DS at RIT - Fall 2021. Please pull the code from this server and work if necessary  

## About Data sourse:

Data files contain 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies 
made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000.

University of Helsinki’s provides a free massive open online course (MOOC) on programming. You can find an updated version of their popular course Object-Oriented Programming with Java. The link to their website is provided below under the credits section. During this course, you will learn the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. I have had a great experience using their resources to learn Java. The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using their automatic testing service "Test My Code". I will recommend the beginner to Computer Science and also the induviduals who are looking to upgrade their skills to sign up with their free course.

## Further Information Grouplense Projects:
The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of 
Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Members of 
the GroupLens Research Project are involved in many research projects related 
to the fields of information filtering, collaborative filtering, and 
recommender systems. The project is lead by professors John Riedl and Joseph 
Konstan. The project began to explore automated collaborative filtering in 
1992, but is most well known for its world wide trial of an automated 
collaborative filtering system for Usenet news in 1996. Since then the project 
has expanded its scope to research overall information filtering solutions, 
integrating in content-based methods as well as improving current collaborative 
filtering technology.

publications, can be found at the following web site:

GroupLens Research currently operates a movie recommender based on 
collaborative filtering:
